# w3-js-clone

- This project is inspired by and based on the W3.js library, originally developed by W3Schools. 
- The code in this repository represents a custom implementation of the W3.js functionality, adapted and written in my own style to suit specific requirements. 

- I express my gratitude to W3Schools for their work on developing the original W3.js library, which has been instrumental in the creation of this project.
